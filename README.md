I code mainly in Java but even try C and Python to keep a hand on the syntax and concepts of those languages.

These codes are solutions for the questions available on mutiple platforms like leetcode, codeforces, inteview-bit, hackerrank, code-chef, hive, spoj etc...
They are for referencial purpose.
